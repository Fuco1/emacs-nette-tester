* nette-tester [[https://travis-ci.org/Fuco1/emacs-nette-tester.svg?branch=master]]

Emacs support for [[https://github.com/nette/tester][Nette Tester]].

* Features

*** Support for compilation mode

If you run tester in compilation-mode, for example by invoking =C-u M-x
compile= command with something like

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./vendor/bin/tester tests
#+END_SRC

the output will be parsed and references to files will be turned into
clickable links.  Also the line with the diff output will become
clickable and will start an ediff session of expected vs actual test
results.

* Usage

Load this package and register =nette-tester= to =compilation-error-regexp-alist=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'emacs-nette-tester)
(push 'nette-tester compilation-error-regexp-alist)
#+END_SRC

That's it!
